3. What are the Benefits of using meta tags ?

* Meta tags provides relevancy

	Meta tags show search engines how relevant your page is to the user’s query.
A query can be anything from “Thai restaurant near me” to “Benefits of jogging every
 morning”. As the information in the meta title tag indicates that the page is of 
interest to the user, the search engine will deliver it on its results page, depending
 on the authority of the page.

* You save time without writing too much

	As meta tags are in the HTML of your website, they are not meant to be long copy.
They need to be short and sweet. You do not want excessive amounts of code on your website.
These are simple and to the point, whether you are writing a meta title or a meta descripti
on. These metadata are usually limited to a few words.

* They optimise your site without making things untidy

	Meta tags do not affect the actual, visible content of your website in any way.
This means that they do not take up space which could be used for selling products or 
services, encouraging social engagement or presenting ideas.Unlike your standard website
 blog posts and articles, you don’t need to ‘strategically’ sprinkle keywords to help 
your page rank on Google.All your metadata is added on the backend of your website. They
 don’t mess up any of your website’s design or content.What it also means is that your 
readers will not have to read through the meta tags to find the content that they want.This
 benefits you as there will not be a high bounce rate due to unnecessary content on the page
 itself.
