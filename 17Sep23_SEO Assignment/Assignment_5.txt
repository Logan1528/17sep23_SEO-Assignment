5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.

	The small graphical representation of the website you are visiting,
 which is visible on the left to the website’s name in the address bar, is 
called a favicon. It is a shortened expression for ‘favorite icon.’ It helps
 you identify the visited website among the many open tabs. For example, The
 fancy P that appears on the tab left of the ProCreator website’s address 
bar is the favicon for us.

Ex:
	
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page Title</title>

  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://icons8.com/icon/LmG49EnUQig9/globe">

</head>
<body>

<h1>Welcome to our webpage</h1>
